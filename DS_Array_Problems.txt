====Array Problem sheet====
1. Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.
 * in brute force can travel to each cell to the left,right,above,below
 * if want to reduce the traversal then use dummy array which in turn will make the space complexity O(R+C)
 * to optimize the better approach to reduce the space complexity, should use the first row and column as dummy
   - want to preserve the actual value and also the dummy values ==> should traverse the matrix from the back
   - and also the first row,col will have conflict as that has to be used for row and column ==> to solve this use different varaible to store the column0 value
   
2.Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return the first N rows of Pascal’s triangle.
  * In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above
  * nCk = (n!)/(n-k)!*(k!)
